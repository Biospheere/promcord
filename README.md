# promcord

## What is promcord?

Promcord is a Discord bot which provides metrics from a Discord server to create insight and alerting on actions and messages. Using [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) you can easily visualize all your metrics in beautiful dashboards.

## Getting Started

This section provides a high-level requirement & quick start guide. **For detailed installations, such as getting started with Maven, Docker, or Grafana, please check out their docs.**


### Prerequisites

- [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) 
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)

#### Docker Installation (local install)

1. Follow the [Docker CE install guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and the [Docker Compose install guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), which illustrates multiple installation options for each OS.
2. Set up your environment variables/secrets in `.env` file
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=<your token>
```
3. Download the [prometheus.yml](prometheus.yml) file to your current directory.
4. Rename the `docker-compose.yml.localsample` to `docker-compose.yml`.
5. Run the Docker App with `docker-compose up -d`.
6. Navigate to http://localhost:80 to access Grafana. Follow [this](https://grafana.com/docs/guides/getting_started/) guide to configure your Grafana server. Prometheus will be added as a datasource in Grafana automatically.
7. That's it! To simplify the creation of Grafana Dashboards, you can download a ready-made dashboard [here](grafana.json) to [import it into Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/reference/export_import/)

#### Docker Installation (production install)

1. Follow the [Docker CE install guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and the [Docker Compose install guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), which illustrates multiple installation options for each OS.
2. Set up your environment variables/secrets in `.env` file
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=<your token>
```
3. Modify the provisioning/datasources/automatic.yml file and change the `access` value to `proxy` AND change the `url` value to `http://prometheus:9090`.
4. Download the [prometheus.yml](prometheus.yml) file to your current directory.
5. Rename the `docker-compose.yml.prodsample` to `docker-compose.yml`.
6. Rename docker-compose.yml.sample to docker-compose.yml (The .sample compose file will contain links in order for Grafana and Prometheus to talk to each other)
7. Run the Docker App with `docker-compose up -d`
8. Navigate to http://ip_address:80 to access Grafana. Follow [this](https://grafana.com/docs/guides/getting_started/) guide to configure your Grafana server. Prometheus will be added as a datasource in Grafana automatically.
9. That's it! To simplify the creation of Grafana Dashboards, you can download a ready-made dashboard [here](grafana.json) to [import it into Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/reference/export_import/)
10. It is recommended you use Nginx and [reverse proxy](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/) to the Grafana instance for production use. Simply change docker-compose.yml Grafana ports from `80:3000` to `3000:3000`, then reverse proxy to http://localhost:3000 in the Nginx configuration. 

### Developer Installation

1. Make sure all the prerequisites are installed.
2. Fork promcord repository, ie. https://github.com/Biospheere/promcord/fork
3. Clone your forked repository, ie. `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/promcord.git`
4. Set up your environment variables/secrets
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=<your token>
```
5. Use [prometheus.yml](prometheus.yml) for Prometheus (Edit target hostname!)
6. Rename the `docker-compose.yml.localsample` to `docker-compose.yml`.
7. That's it! Go to [http://your-ip:grafana-port](http://localhost:3000) to access Grafana. Then follow [this](https://grafana.com/docs/guides/getting_started/) guide to configure your Grafana server.
