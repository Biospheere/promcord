# promcord

Promcord is a Discord bot which provides metrics from a Discord server to create insight and alerting on actions and messages. Using [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) you can easily visualize all your metrics in beautiful dashboards.

## Installation

Use Docker Compose to install promcord. 
If you have already created a Discord Bot you can skip this step. 
Otherwise, see [this](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token) introduction on how to create a Discord bot and get the token of your new bot.

Create a .env file and set the required values in it.

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=<your token>
```

Start the Docker containers with the following command: 

```
docker-compose up -d
```

To run Grafana open your browser and go to [http://your-ip:80](http://localhost:80). Then follow [this](https://grafana.com/docs/guides/getting_started/) guide to configure your Grafana server.
